Farmcoin is a programming assignment I wrote for Stanford's
Introduction to Systems class, or [CS 110](http://cs110.stanford.edu).
It's a simple Bitcoin clone, meant to teach the basics of the
blockchain.  The handout describing the assignment can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k2MpJwaE_7zCnf3_Zb_33aPMZkdATusDRpH7SjfLuJU/edit?usp=sharing).

Building
========
The code in this repostory doesn't build, since it has few private
Stanford dependencies, including a thread pool and a few utilities.
It's instead meant as a starting point for students who'd like to
learn more about the blockchain, or teachers who'd like to offer their
own blockchain programming assignment.
