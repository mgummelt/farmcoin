Farmcoin is a programming assignment I wrote for Stanford's [CS110
Introduction to Systems](http://cs110.stanford.edu).  It's a simple
Bitcoin clone, meant to teach the basics of the blockchain.  The
handout describing the assignment can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k2MpJwaE_7zCnf3_Zb_33aPMZkdATusDRpH7SjfLuJU/edit?usp=sharing).

Building
========
The code in this repostory doesn't build, since it has few private
Stanford dependencies, including a thread pool and a few utilities.
It's instead meant as a starting point for students who'd like to
learn more about the blockchain, or teachers who'd like to offer their
own blockchain programming assignment.  If you'd like to provide this
assignment in your own class, please contact me and I can help you get
started!
